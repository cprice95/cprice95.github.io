                    One of the things I enjoy doing is remodeling a home or looking at a space and wondering how I can reconfigure it to be more functional for the home. I also love to select the different home décor elements that will fit in with someone’s taste, as a home is a reflection of oneself. I would like to enlighten you on the stages an interior design goes through when creating and executing their project.
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading2">Design Phases</h2>
        
                <h3 class="heading3">Programming</h3>
                <img src="Images/bubble chart.jpg" align="right" width="500" height="300" id="bc1" alt="Bubble Chart">
                <p class="sub-title">
                    During this stage is where the designer does research to get to know their clients, the nature of the project, purpose of the space and the extent of the design work. This is also the part of the process where the designer really learns the objectives, requirements, and the constraints of the project to base their design around. A <i>bubble diagram</i> is used to sketch the spatial and activity relationships as well as traffic flow as shown in the picture to the right. All the data is analyzed and used to create a program document that shows the design problem and outlines a solution for the clients to look over and approve.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h3 class="heading3">Concept Development</h3>
                <img src="Images/schematic sketch.jpg" align="left" width= "400" height="275" id="sd1" alt="Schematic Drawing">
                <p class="sub-title">
                    After the clients approve the design program document, the ideation stage takes place. This involves brainstorming different design solutions and eliminating the unworkable ideas to create the main design concepts. The main design concept shows the ideas and approach behind the design solution.  <i>Schematic drawings</i> are also used as a quick visualization of the main ideas of the proposed design.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="heading3"\>Presentation</h3>

                <p class="sub-title">
                    One or more design concepts may be presented to the client as a proposal for them to review, provide feedback and approve. The proposal will consist of the following things:
                    <br>
                    <br>&bull; concept statement with supporting conceptual drawings and a mood board showing color, materials
                    <br>&bull; additional sketches, perspective drawings, full color renderings, 3-D model or computer simulations
                    <br>&bull; cost estimates including materials, labor, and fee for design services
                    <br>&bull; time frame showing the sequence of events and the proposed completion date

                </p>
                <h3 class="heading3">Design and Documentation</h3>

                <p class="sub-title">
                    At this stage in the design process is where the final <i>construction drawings</i> are created. These will include perspective drawings, stie plans, floor plans, reflected ceiling plans (showing lighting and ceiling fixtures), sections, elevations, and detailed drawings of architectural elements <i>(doors and windows)</i> and design elements <i>(paint, trim, wall coverings, and window treatments)</i> as well as all drawing notes that are necessary for the construction and installation of the design. A <i>specifications list</i> to describe in detail of all the furnishings and materials that will be needed as well having <i> schedules</i> that list the type, finishes and placement of the architectural and design elements is important to the development of the final design.
                </p>

                <h3 class="heading3">Execution</h3>

                <img src="Images/construction process.png" align="right" width="400" height="250" alt="">
                <p class="sub-title">
                    Once approval has been given for the final design, the designer finally gets to execute their design. Contractors’ give bids for the project and the designer prepares a detailed schedule of what needs to be done (choreographing construction, installations and the finishings in the proper order). Materials are ordered and goods are delivered. The designer will make regular visits to the work site to co-ordinate progress, inspect quality of the workmanship, and resolve any issues that have come up on-site. Once construction and installation are complete, the designer will make up a list of defects to be resolved before any furnishings or accessories can be brought in.
                </p>

                <h3 class="heading3">Evaluation</h3>

                <img src="Images/Final walk through with client.jpg" align="left" width="300" height="200" id="fwtwc1" alt="">
                <p class="sub-title">
                    This is an important final step in the design process when the designer follows up after the completion of the project to evaluate the success of the design. A walk-through inspection with the client, questionnaire, or an interview could be done for the evaluation. The designer might make adjustments and revisions to improve the result if needed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                <P class="sub-title">
                    There is a lot of work and technical items involved in the design process that people don’t realize. However, the look on the clients face when they see the completed design for the first time makes all the hard work worth it. As a designer, it is very satisfying when a client accepts and approves of the designs that you’ve worked so hard to create.
