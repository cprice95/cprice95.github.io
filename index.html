                <p class="sub-title"> 
                    I thoroughly enjoy creating, designing and incorporating multiple different elements and perspectives that result in something new. I like to make sure things are functional as well as to have a pleasing aesthetic. As you might has noticed, my website is a reflection of myself, full of color. With my degree in Interior Design and my many years of customer service, I’m experienced with combining the needs and wants of customers with the rules of design or the ones set in place by the business. I’ve previously worked in the food service industry, retail environments, and most recently customer service call centers.

                    I want to be a software engineer because the possibilities for being imaginative are endless and it is an industry that is ever growing as it impacts a lot of things we use on a regular basis. I have always loved electronics and have always been quick to understand how they work. I love to be challenged and with the things I’ve learned so far, I find it very intriguing to see how writing code can turn into a something as complex as a functioning website. I look forward to learning more about software engineering to further develop my skills as well as using my background and my newly learned skills to continue creating new things.
